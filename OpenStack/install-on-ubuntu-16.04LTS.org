#+TITLE: OpenStack Installation

* Ubuntu Server Install

We are using Ubuntu 16.04 Server. During the install we choose and
Guided *LVM partitioning layout*. This is important as LVM2 is required
for the Cinder volume storage to be created.

We do not need and unpartitioned space but make sure that you have
over *20GB free space on the root partition*.

DevStack will create loopback files to use as devices.

During the install we add in the *OpenSSH Server*, *Standard System Tools*
and basic Ubuntu Server for the task selection menu.

* Install Python Systemd Support

DevStack needs to be able to link in to systemd to manage services and
as such will require the libraries to be installed:

:  [tux@devstack ~]$ sudo apt-get install -y python-systemd

* Create User Account

The services that the DevStack install uses will need their own
account. This account must have access to root privileges with
sudo. In the following code you will see that we create the user stack
with a default bash shell and a home directory located at
/opt/stack. The -m option ensure the home directory is created.

:  [tux@devstack ~]$ sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
:  [tux@devstack ~]$ echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack

* Clone the DevStack GIT Repo

The git client will be installed in 16.04 server by default so we
should not need to add it. If we switch to the stack user account we
can clone the latest DevStack repo. We then change to the downloaded
code by moving into the devstack directory which will be in the home
directory of the stack user.

:  [tux@devstack ~]$ sudo su -l stack 
:  [tux@devstack ~]$ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
:  [tux@devstack ~]$ cd /opt/stack/devstack

* DevStack Answer File

We can create an answer file with the minimum configuration
included. This will install the services onto the single host but we
set the password to be used. You should create a *local.conf* file in
the root of the devstack directory. You, of course, can use a
different password if you prefer and make sure that you use your IP
ADDRESS:

:  [[local|localrc]]
:  ADMIN_PASSWORD=Password1
:  DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
:  RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
:  SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
:  HOST_IP=10.0.2.4

* Editing the /etc/hosts File

We also want to make sure that we reference the actual host IP in the
/etc/hosts file. You will see in the video that I add an entry to the
file that reads like this. Making sure you use your IP Address and
hostname:

:  10.0.2.4  devstack

* Starting the Install

From the root of the devstack directory we can initiate the install by
running the stack.sh script. This will take 20-40 minutes depending on
the speed of your system and network

:  [tux@devstack ~]$ ./stack.sh
